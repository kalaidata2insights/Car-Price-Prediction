# Car-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning project for predicting used car prices
🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars based on various features such as car brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. Machine Learning regression models are used to analyze patterns in historical data and make accurate price predictions.

📌 Project Overview

Buying or selling a used car can be challenging due to price uncertainty. This project aims to:
- Analyze key factors influencing car prices
- Build machine learning models to predict car prices
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding and Scaling
- Model Training and Evaluation

 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

📊 Models Implemented

- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- (Add more if you used them)

📈 Evaluation Metrics

- R² Score  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
